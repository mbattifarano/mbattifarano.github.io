![Me]({{ "/assets/mattbattifarano.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I apply advances in computing, sensing, data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to improve transportation systems. I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research in the [Mobility Data Analytics Center](http://mac.heinz.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University examines the role of new and emerging technologies in transportation and their impacts on mobility. I focus on transportation network modeling with shared mobility, connected vehicles, and autonomous vehicles in order to develop strategies for their deployment.

Previously, I served as a data scientist at [Bridj](http://www.bridj.com/), a small firm designing and deploying a smart micro-bus platform for urban transit. I worked at the intersection of research and software engineering building models of transit demand and operationalizing our fleet routing optimization engine. Additionally, I served as a consultant to Transit Systems Austrlia during their acquistion of the Bridj software.

I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2012 with major in Mathematics and a minor in Computational Neuroscience.
