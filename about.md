I apply advances in computing, sensing, data engineering, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to improve transportation systems.

My research in the [Mobility Data Analytics Center](http://mac.heinz.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University examines the role of new and emerging technologies in transportation and their impacts on mobility. I focus on transportation network modeling with shared mobility, connected vehicles, and autonomous vehicles in order to develop strategies for their deployment.

Previously, I served as a data scientist at Bridj, a small firm designing and deploying a smart micro-bus platform for urban transit. I worked at the intersection of research and software engineering, building models of transit demand and operationalizing our fleet routing optimization engine.
